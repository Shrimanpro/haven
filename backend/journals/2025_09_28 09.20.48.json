I snapped at a coworker, which I regret. After coming home, I felt drained but managed to cook myself dinner. Writing this down makes me realize I don\u2019t give myself credit for the small wins, like actually eating well tonight. I just wish I could stop feeling like I\u2019m always running out of time.\n"}
