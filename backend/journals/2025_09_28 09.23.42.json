At work, I finished a project I\u2019d been struggling with, and my manager gave me genuine praise. In the evening, I cooked dinner with my sibling and we laughed the whole time. I feel proud of myself for keeping up with healthy habits and grateful for the small joys that made the day feel light.\n"}
